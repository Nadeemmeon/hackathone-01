# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module focuses on the middleware foundations for humanoid robot control, specifically using ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) as the "nervous system" that enables communication between different components of a humanoid robot.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Explain how ROS 2 functions as a robotic nervous system
- Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 architecture (nodes, topics, services, DDS)
- Describe how AI agents interface with robot hardware using Python and rclpy
- Understand how humanoid robots are modeled using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
- Explain the role of URDF in both simulation and real-world robot control

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters that build upon each other:

1. **[ROS 2 Architecture for Humanoids](./ros2-architecture-for-humanoids.md)** - Understanding the communication infrastructure
2. **[Python Agents and Robot Control](./python-agents-and-robot-control.md)** - Bridging AI logic to actuators
3. **[Modeling the Body with URDF](./modeling-the-body-with-urdf.md)** - Representing robot structure and kinematics

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Understanding of AI/ML fundamentals

## Next Steps

Begin with the first chapter: [ROS 2 Architecture for Humanoids](./ros2-architecture-for-humanoids.md).
