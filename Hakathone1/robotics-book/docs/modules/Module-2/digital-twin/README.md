# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module focuses on digital twin technology, which creates virtual representations of physical robot systems that mirror their real-world behavior and characteristics. Digital twins are essential for testing, validation, and development of humanoid robots in safe, controlled virtual environments.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand the role of digital twins in robotics development and testing
- Explain physics simulation with Gazebo for realistic humanoid robot testing
- Describe how Unity enables high-fidelity rendering for human-robot interaction
- Understand how sensor simulation provides data for AI perception systems
- Articulate the differences between Gazebo and Unity for robotics simulation

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters that build upon each other:

1. **[Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./physics-simulation-with-gazebo.md)** - Understanding physics-based simulation and dynamics
2. **[Human-Robot Interaction in Unity](./human-robot-interaction-unity.md)** - High-fidelity rendering and interactive environments
3. **[Sensor Simulation](./sensor-simulation.md)** - Connecting simulation to AI perception systems

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Module 1 (The Robotic Nervous System)
- Understanding of ROS 2 architecture and concepts
- Basic knowledge of robotics simulation concepts

## Next Steps

Begin with the first chapter: [Physics Simulation with Gazebo](./physics-simulation-with-gazebo.md).
