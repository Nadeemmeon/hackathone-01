# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

## Overview

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. This module focuses on AI perception and navigation for humanoid robotics using the NVIDIA Isaac platform. The content covers perception, navigation, and accelerated robotics AI, structured as one overview and three detailed chapters.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this module, you will be able to:

- Understand how NVIDIA Isaac Sim enables the creation of photorealistic environments for training perception models safely
- Explain how Isaac ROS enables hardware-accelerated perception and Visual SLAM for humanoid localization and mapping
- Describe how Nav2 enables path planning and how navigation concepts are adapted for bipedal robots
- Articulate the role of NVIDIA Isaac in accelerated robotics AI
- Understand how AI perception is trained and deployed using synthetic data

## Module Structure

This module is divided into three chapters that build upon each other:

1. **[NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data](./nvidia-isaac-sim-synthetic-data.md)** - Understanding photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
2. **[Isaac ROS and Visual SLAM](./isaac-ros-visual-slam.md)** - Hardware-accelerated perception and localization
3. **[Navigation with Nav2](./navigation-with-nav2.md)** - Path planning and bipedal robot navigation

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of Module 1 (The Robotic Nervous System) and Module 2 (The Digital Twin)
- Basic knowledge of AI perception and navigation concepts
- Familiarity with NVIDIA Isaac platform concepts

## Next Steps

Begin with the first chapter: [NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data](./nvidia-isaac-sim-synthetic-data.md).
